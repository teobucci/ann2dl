\section{Introduction}

\que{Does learning rate have some relationship with the dying neurons issue? Why? (0.5/1 Pts.)}

\begin{box-stud}
    No. It doesn't. Because the dying neuron problem is due to the ReLU activation function and happens when a neuron is stuck in the negative part of the domain, where it cannot learn anything. In this case, modifying the learning help won't be of any help, because the problem lies in the ReLU activation function and we need to change that to Leaky ReLU in order to fix this issue.
\end{box-stud}

    \begin{itemize}[label=]
        \item A low learning rate does not compromise training
        \item[\ok] A high learning rate might compromise training
        \item The higher the learning rate the better the training
        \item[\ok] The learning rate should be reduced while training
    \end{itemize}
\end{box-sol}

You suspect this could be due to VANISHING/EXPLODING GRADIENT, what would you look at to check THIS hypothesis? HINT: Six and only six are correct; if you mark more, these will be counted as errors, if you mark less you are loosing points. (3 Pts.)}

\que{Briefly describe what Siamese networks are and what they are used for. (2/2 Pts.)}
\begin{box-stud}
    Siamese networks is a concept that arise in the field of Metric Learning. In particular, they can be found in tasks of template matching. In these tasks, we want to compare a template with an image to verify if it is one of the templates we have or not. E.g. suppose that we want to open a door automatically only if an employee comes to work, we will have an image of the employ and a camera taking a real image of the person in front of the door. Since the data are small, we cannot learn a network performing the task directly because we have few samples and we should retrain the model at each employee change. Then, Siamese network solve the problem. We train a CNN on a large dataset to recognize the elements we want to recognize to be able to produce an embedding. When the network is finished, we remove the fully connected network on top of it and we copy the network: we have two identical copies of the same network performing the embedding. At test time, we generate the embedding of the sample and of the templates with the two networks: one embed templates and one the real sample. Then, we will classify the sample as the template to which the embedding is closest.
\end{box-stud}


\que{What is the dying neuron problem and how would you fix it? (2 Pts.)}
\begin{box-stud}
    The dying neuron problem is a problem we have with ReLU activation function. Since the ReLU activation function is defined as f(x)=max(Ox), it is null in case x < 0. Its gradient is always unitary when f(x)=x and it becomes null for <0. If the updates make a neuron go in that part of the space (x<0), the neuron will die by being turned off. This is called dying neuron problem. We can fix the dying neuron problem by slightly changing the ReLU activation function. The ReLU activation function can be redefined to be f(x)=0.001x for x<0 and f(x) =x for x> =0. In this case, the gradient will never be null and the problem of the dying neuron is solved since the neuron will only enter a region in which it is lower. However, there still remains the problem of non differentiability in O. Then, we can use a modification of the ReLU activation function called ELU. It solves both the vanishing gradient problem and the non differentiability problem of the ReLU function in 0.

\que{What are the major differences when training feed forward neural networks for regression and for classification? Motivate your answer (20 Pts.)}

\que{Let's start from the core issue of machine learning, i.e, the overfitting/generalization trade-off. Discuss if and how deep learning (as a general paradigm) differs from (classical) machine learning regarding the overfitting issue. Hints: start by defining the concepts, then highlight the differences, then connect if/how these differences are related to overfitting/generalization. (30 Pts.)}

\begin{box-stud}
    The issue of overfitting happens when a machine learning model or a dep learning network is being trained. This issue happens when the model is learning the training data too much and in doing it loses the ability to generalize. This issue happens in machine learning when the model is too complex and the model starts to model not only the structure behind the data but also the noise over it. A deep neural network can compute any function with the right weights and the right number of neurons and deep enough models, it usually happens that the network is a really complex model and the risk of overfitting is high. The issue for neural network is also that it can end up learning features which are too specific for the training set and which does not generalize. In traditional machine learning this issue is more connected with the complexity of the model which uses the hand crafted features

\que{Which loss function should be used in regression according to the Maximum A-Posterior approach? Why?}

\que{Which loss function should be used in regression according to the Maximum Likelihood approach? Why?
(10/15 Pts.)}

\begin{box-stud}
    Grazie alla MLE abbiamo capito che la migliore loss function per la regressione Ã¨ la mean squared error. Questo deriva della probabilitÃ  condizionata degli input dati i pesi, di cui viene tatto il logaritmo e successivamente calcolato il gradiente rispetto ai pesi e posto uguale a zero.
\end{box-stud}

\begin{box-sol}
    According to MLE the best function for regression is sum of squared errors. This is due to the assumption the output target t follows a Gaussian distribution ast ~ g(x|w) + N(O,sigma). Given N lid samples from t and computing the likelihood of the sample we derive that the maximum is obtained in case of the minimization of the sum or squared errors.
\end{box-sol}


\que{What are the issues of the ReLU activation function? How could you solve them? (15/20 Pts.)}

\begin{box-stud}
    I principale problema della relu Ã¨ che se dovessimo trovarci nella parte Â«O della funzione l'output sarebbe pari a zero e rischieremmo di avere un vanishing gradient. Per ovviare a questo problema si puÃ²: Usare una leaky ReLu, che non soffre di questo problema Usare un batch gradient descend, che diminuicro la nrahabilitÃ  di trovarci nella parteâ€¦
\end{box-stud}

\que{How would you decide for the activation function of the output layer of a deep neural network? (20/20 Pts.)}

\begin{box-stud}
Dipende dalla task che la rete deve svolgere, se abbiamo un classificatore binario le piÃ¹ adatte sono sigmoide e tangente iperbolica, se abbiamo un classificatore generico (n classi) la migliore Ã¨ la softmax, se invece abbiamo un regressore la migliore Ã¨ una funzione lineare o una relu (nel caso in cui il valore non potesse essere inferiore a zero.\end{box-stud}

\que{Make an example of deep learning model, i.e., a deep neural network, for supervised learning describing it briefly in terms of goal, architecture and loss function. (20/20 Pts.)}

\begin{box-stud}
Un esempio di modello di DL con supervised learning Ã¨ un modello usato per la classificazione di immagini. Infatti nel training set il modello riceve delle immagini con assegnate delle etichette prese da un insieme prestabilito (rispettivamente input e target output). Lobiettivo del modello Ã¨ imparare ad associare a ogni immagine l'etichetta (tra le etichette del nostro insieme) che la rappresenta. Le architetture possono essere diverse, se usiamo un classificatore lineare l'architettura sarÃ  un feed forwrd neural network, ma possiamo usare anche delle convolutional neural networks, avendo anche dei layer convoluzionali e di pooling nell'architettura. In entrambi i casi la loss function sarÃ  una crossentropy, la piÃ¹ adatta per la classificazione.

\que{What is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning? (5/10 Pts.)}

\begin{box-stud}

\end{box-stud}

\que{What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning? (10/10 Pts.)}

\begin{box-stud}[(10/10 Pts.)]
La sostanziale differenza tra ML e DL Ã¨ che il primo ha bisogno di un feature engineer per estrarre delle feature, mentre il secondo lo fa automaticamente in modo data-driven. PiÃ¹ nello specifico, nel caso del ML un feature engineer scova, grazie a conoscenze pregresse e dati esterni, dele feature che serviranno al modello per risolvere un task, mentre nel DL il modello stesso cerca queste feature nei dati usati per 'allenamento, estraendo feature sempre piÃ¹ astratte, addirittura ininterpretabili per l'occhio umano.
